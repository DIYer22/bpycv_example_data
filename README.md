# Example Data for [`bpycv`](https://github.com/DIYer22/bpycv)

## Data source
 - background_and_light: [HDRI Haven](https://hdrihaven.com/hdris/)
 - models: YCB dataset
 - distractor: ShapeNet
 - texture: [Texture Haven](https://texturehaven.com/)

Notice: 
 > Blender may can't direct load `.obj` and `.dea` file from YCB and ShapeNet dataset.  
 > It's better to transefer and format by [`meshlabserver`](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab/releases).    
 > All `.obj` in this repositories are transefered by run `meshlabserver -i raw.obj -o for_blender.obj -m wt`
